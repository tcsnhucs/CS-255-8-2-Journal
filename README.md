## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The driverpass project involved creating a website for the client, Driverpass, in order to allow them to help schedule lessons for their students, and create online lessons to help students pass their driver exams. They wanted me to design the system design diagrams, and create a plan of how the system will work once it is put in a functional design.
## What did you do particularly well?
I feel that my diagrams that I created to represent the system do a really good job at encompassing the system, and ensuring that anyone can understand it.
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that I could have improved my descriptions of the nonfunctional requirements. For my functional requirements, I made sure I wrote them in a specific style that I only started conforming to after I had already written my nonfunctional requirements. In retrospect, I should have written them all in that style.
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpretted their needs as simply hearing what they needed and ensuring that those needs were put to the forefront of the design. The users needs are so important because that is who will be using your product, and if their needs aren't met they simply will not use your product.
## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing software is to have a thorough plan laid out beforehand and follow that plan. If you know what you're going to be doing before it is written, than it makes the process of writing the code so much easier, since you always know what you are supposed to do to ensure you can fulfill the functions you need fulfilled.
